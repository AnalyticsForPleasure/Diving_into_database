# CASE_0891321 - First row of 42 rows - case have been close at trasacttion number 21
# CASE_0891345 - First row of 29 rows - case have been close at trasacttion number 16
# CASE_0892368 - First row of 27 rows - case have been close at trasacttion number 16
# CASE_0892441 - First row of 82 rows - case have been close at trasacttion number 42


SELECT Time_stamp , EventType, DetectiveId , CaseId , Properties
FROM DetectiveCases
WHERE CaseId = 'CASE_0892441';


# Step Num 1 : extracting the bounty value from the properties in order to count the sum of bounties,
# filtering rows which satisfied the constraint where EventType = 'CaseOpened'
SELECT  EventType , CaseId , JSON_EXTRACT(Properties, '$.Bounty') AS bounty_value
FROM DetectiveCases
WHERE EventType = 'CaseOpened';


#  Step Num 2 : Creating table number 2
Select EventType,  CaseId , DetectiveId
from DetectiveCases
WHERE EventType = 'CaseSolved';


## Step Num 3 : Create a temporary table named 'temp_table_for_bounty'
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table_for_bounty AS
SELECT  EventType , CaseId , JSON_EXTRACT(Properties, '$.Bounty') AS bounty_value
FROM DetectiveCases
WHERE EventType = 'CaseOpened';

## Step Num 4 : Create a temporary table named 'temp_table_for_case_solved'
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table_for_case_solved AS
Select EventType,  CaseId , DetectiveId
from DetectiveCases
WHERE EventType = 'CaseSolved';

select *
from temp_table_for_detective;


## Step Num 5 : applying an inner join between the 2 temporary tables + I added the order by in order to see the number of bounties each Detective have

Select temp_table_for_case_solved.DetectiveId , temp_table_for_case_solved.CaseId ,  temp_table_for_bounty.bounty_value
from temp_table_for_bounty
inner join temp_table_for_case_solved
On temp_table_for_bounty.CaseId = temp_table_for_case_solved.CaseId
ORDER BY temp_table_for_case_solved.DetectiveId;


## Step Num 6 : adding a inner join between the 2 temporary tables + I added the order by in order to see the number of bounties each Detective have + adding at the end a new temporary table
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table_solve_cases_with_bounty_values AS
Select temp_table_for_case_solved.DetectiveId , temp_table_for_case_solved.CaseId ,  temp_table_for_bounty.bounty_value
from temp_table_for_bounty
inner join temp_table_for_case_solved
On temp_table_for_bounty.CaseId = temp_table_for_case_solved.CaseId
ORDER BY temp_table_for_case_solved.DetectiveId;


## Step Num 7 : applying group by + order by - for see the bounties by using aggregation sum function
select Detectiveid , sum(bounty_value) As sum_bounties_for_each_detective
from temp_table_solve_cases_with_bounty_values
group by Detectiveid
order by sum_bounties_for_each_detective desc;

##  'kvc232d2114ea87576155e'


## Step Num 8 : Dropping the temporary tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_table_for_bounty;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_table_for_case_solved;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_table_finally_merge;
